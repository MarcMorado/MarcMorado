    <b>welcome to my GitHub!</b><br><br>
    <i>
        I'm Marc.<br>
        A passionate and dedicated Front-End Developer,<br>
        primarily focusing on crafting user-friendly experiences with React.js.<br>
    </i><br>
    <i>
    üíª I have honed my skills in the vast world of front-end development, particularly reveling in the intricacies of Three.js, which has allowed me to render impressive 3D graphics and create immersive web experiences.<br>

üöÄ Additionally, I am proficient in Next.js, helping me build server-side rendering and static site generation for React web applications. My toolkit also includes modern JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, ensuring I am prepared to tackle any challenges and deliver high-quality, performance-optimized, and scalable projects.<br>

üåê Being a Front-End Developer isn't only about the languages and libraries, though. I'm also adept at using a variety of tools and software, like Git for version control, npm for package management, Webpack for bundling my applications, and Babel for keeping up with the latest JS syntax.<br>

üîç I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies. That's why I continually push my boundaries in this ever-evolving tech landscape.<br>

ü§ù I believe in open-source as the best way to learn and grow as a developer. Feel free to check out my repositories, contribute, or get in touch!<br>
